# SpaceTourism
For this project, I will be creating a SPA website using react.js. This project will have 4 web pages: the Home page, Destination page, Crew, page, and Technology page. The Home page will have a brief description of the project, the Destination page will have multiple destinations or planets that the user can choose from and get more information about that planet or moon, the Crew page will have multiple crew members where the user can choose from and get more information about them, and the Technology page will have multiple technologies involved in in the journey through space that the user can choose from and get more information about that technology.
